# Soft Pretzels

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 2 1/4 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp melted butter
- 3 3/4 cups flour
- coarse salt for sprinkling
- 1/2 cup baking soda
- 9 cups water

## Directions

1. Whisk the yeast into warm water. Allow to sit for 1 minute. 
2. Whisk in salt, brown sugar, and melted butter. 
3. Slowly add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix with a wooden spoon (or dough hook attached to stand mixer) until dough is thick. Add 3/4 cup more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. If it is still sticky, add 1/4 – 1/2 cup more, as needed. Poke the dough with your finger – if it bounces back, it is ready to knead.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough for 3 minutes and shape into a ball. Cover lightly with a towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. (Meanwhile, I like to get the water + baking soda boiling as instructed in step 6.)
5. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). 
6. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
7. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 1/3 cup sections.
8. Roll the dough into a 20-22 inch rope. Form a circle with the dough by bringing the two ends together at the top of the circle. Twist the ends together. Bring the twisted ends back down towards yourself and press them down to form a pretzel shape
9. Bring baking soda and 9 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Drop 1-2 pretzels into the boiling water for 20-30 seconds
10. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown
